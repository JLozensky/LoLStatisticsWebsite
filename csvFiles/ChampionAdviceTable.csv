1,Striking killing blows on minions with Disintegrate enables Annie to farm extremely well early in the game.,Summoner Smite can be used to help take down Tibbers.
1,"Molten Shield is a good spell to cast to work up to Annie's stun, so sometimes it's beneficial to grab at least 1 rank in it early.","Keep an eye out for a white, swirling power around Annie. It means she's ready to unleash her stun."
2,"Olaf can combine Berserker Rage, Vicious Strikes, and Ragnarok at low life to become deceptively strong.",Olaf becomes more dangerous the lower life he is. Save your disables to finish him off.
2,The bonus healing granted by Vicious Strikes amplifies your Life Steal from all sources as well as heals from allies.,Preventing Olaf from reaching his axe will minimize the amount of harassment he can cause in the laning phase.
2,,"Olaf has reduced defenses from damage during Ragnarok, despite being immune to disables. If you can't escape from Olaf during Ragnarok, try focusing your damage on him with your teammates."
3,You can release Shield of Durand even while crowd controlled.,Galio moves slower when he is charging Shield of Durand.
3,You can use the minimap ally icons to cast Hero's Entrance.,Hero's Entrance can be interrupted before Galio jumps into the air.

4,Coordinate with your allies for the best time to use Destiny to ambush enemies.,Focus on dodging Wild Cards early when your champion doesn't have the hit points to afford getting hit.
4,Stealth characters often escape a battle with very low hit points. Take advantage of Destiny's ability to reveal stealthed units to finish them off.,"If you have low Health, use Destiny as an indicator to run to safety. It will give you a head start in escaping any possible ganks."
4,"Twisted Fate is viable as an Attack Damage or Ability Power character, letting him fit on many different team compositions.",
5,Xin Zhao is a great initiator to combat. Lead the front to start a fight and use your ultimate to do the most damage possible.,Xin Zhao is a powerful initiator with both his charge and ultimate dealing damage to all units around him. Try having your team stay spread out until he's used his ultimate.
5,Try to position yourself so your ultimate's knockback is most effective.,"Xin Zhao relies heavily on his Three Talon Strikes for damage and cooldown resets, so preventing him from finishing his combo will have a dramatic effect."
6,"Pay attention to your individual leg's cooldowns, as they make for a signficiant portion of your damage","Urgot relies heavily on blasting opponents with his legs, which have their own cooldowns and only detonate when he attacks in the direction they are facing. Avoid getting hit by multiple."
6,Land Corrosive Charge or Disdain to lock on to target's with Purge - a great way to trigger multiple legs in rapid succession.,"Urgot can deal and absorb tremendous amounts of damage with Purge, but slows himself while firing."
6,Save Fear Beyond Death for opponents you know are already too weak to survive. It's especially good for picking off fleeing foes.,"If you are struck by Fear Beyond Death, do your best to avoid falling below the execution threshold (25% of your Maximum Health) until the effect times out."
7,Distortion allows you to be aggressive with your other spells while being able to return to safety.,"LeBlanc's ultimate can create fake LeBlancs during her spellcast or, rarely, at a distant position. "
7,Using Distortion can help your positioning to land Ethereal Chains.,"The fake LeBlanc created at a distance will always run at the nearest Champion, cast a harmless spell, then immediately disappear."
7,You can chain Sigil of Malice and Ethereal Chains to prevent characters with blink from escaping for up to 4 seconds.,"Attacking LeBlanc first avoids most of her tricks, especially if she's recently used her dash, Distortion."
7,,Stunning or silencing LeBlanc will prevent her from activating the return part of Distortion.
8,"Transfusion instantly deals damage to the enemy before healing Vladimir, making it one of the best last hitting tools in the game.","Try to take Vladimir down before Hemoplague detonates, as it will heal him for each afflicted enemy Champion."
8,Cast Hemoplague where it will afflict the most units.,Making Vladimir use Sanguine Pool at the start of a fight will maximize the Health cost of the ability to him.
8,"Sanguine Pool pops incoming missiles, so it can be used to dodge disables.","Items that counter Health stacking, such as Liandry's Torment and Blade of the Ruined King, are very effective against Vladimir."
10,Using Divine Judgment on a high-DPS ally can turn the tides of battle by giving your ally free reign to attack. ,"Divine Judgment only grants Kayle or her allies immunity to damage. Slows and stuns can still be applied, so trap them if they're being overzealous."
10,Kayle's attacks become incredibly powerful once she gains attack range from Divine Ascent. Play safe until then. ,"Kayle is usually a fragile target. If you see her ultimate cast on an ally, switch to attacking her."
10,"Kayle benefits greatly from Attack Damage and Ability Power, making hybrid items like Nashor's Tooth and Hextech Gunblade very effective on her.",Kayle starts the game as a weaker melee champion. Try to put her behind before she ascends to her ranged form.
11,"If you're in a lane against ranged players, leveling up Meditate can allow you to stay in the lane longer and gain levels faster than they will.","Meditate is an effective method of healing damage over time, but Master Yi is susceptible to coordinated team ganks early in the game."
11,Wuju Style is very strong early for last hitting minions.,"If Master Yi tries to farm with Alpha Strike, hit him a few times so he has to use mana with Meditate to heal."
11,Try using Alpha Strike on a minion in front of an enemy champion so you are placed at a safe distance at the end of the spell.,"Although Master Yi cannot be slowed while using Highlander, other disables can stop him in his tracks."
12,Using Pulverize can allow you to establish better positioning for Headbutt.,Alistar is very disruptive but very tough - try to target more fragile damage dealers.
12,Movement speed is very important on Alistar. Consider which boots to buy carefully.,Watch out for the Pulverize-Headbutt combo when around turrets.
12,Using Flash can allow you catch your target off guard to knock them back into your allies with Pulverize and Headbutt.,"When Alistar uses his ultimate, it's often better to move back and wait until the effect wears off before attacking him."
13,Use Overload's passive to optimize for maximum damage or maximum speed.,Ryze is especially dangerous to opponents that are marked with Flux.
13,Spell Flux's short cooldown allows it to be used to spread Flux to many enemies.,Use Realm Warp's windup time to figure out how to deal with what may be coming out of the portal.
13,Ryze can move and cast other spells while Realm Warp is charging without cancelling the portal.,Crowd controlling Ryze during Realm Warp's windup will cancel the portal.
14,"You only have very slight turning ability during Unstoppable Onslaught, so make sure to use it in straight paths.","Even if Sion still hits a Decimating Smash, making him release the charge earlier reduces its impact."
14,Roar of the Slayer is a great setup ability to land a very powerful Decimating Smash.,Use the time after Sion has died to reposition and prepare for his return.
14,"The Soul Furnace buff displays how much shield strength is remaining, use this information to time its explosion perfectly.",
15,"Sivir's Boomerang Blade returns to her after reaching the max range, so you can shift position to hit enemies who would otherwise have evaded it.","Boomerang Blade costs a lot of mana to cast, so dodging it sets Sivir back. If it hits you on the way out, avoid its path on the way back."
15,"Ricochet resets Sivir's basic attack timer on activation, so activating this immediately after landing a normal basic attack will maximize damage output.","Sivir is a powerful pushing champion, so leaving her unattended in a lane for too long will often result in your turrets being destroyed."
15,Try saving Spell Shield for enemy abilities that can disable you such as stuns and roots.,"When laning against Sivir, it is possible to throw off the timing of her Spell Shield by faking an advance, then backing off."
16,"Soraka is a powerful ally in battle, using her strong healing to keep the party moving forward.",Focus on attacking Soraka when she ever ventures to the frontline to heal her allies.
16,You can use Wish on your allies from across the map to save them from otherwise fatal events.,Take advantage of Soraka's long cooldown on Equinox if she uses it to harass.
16,Equinox can be used as a powerful zoning tool to keep enemies at bay.,It's easier to focus Soraka than the ally she is healing.
17,Teemo's mushrooms can be used to farm creep waves very effectively.,"Teemo's Toxic Shot punishes players who get hit and back out, so stay at a safe range until you're ready to commit."
17,"Place your mushrooms at key locations on the map, such as by the Dragon or Baron Nashor, to reveal when your enemies might be attempting to kill them.",It can be valuable to use Oracle's Lens(Trinket) to destroy mushrooms around key locations.
18,Her massive gun allows Tristana to fire on targets at a great distance. Utilize this to prevent your enemies from ever laying a hand on you.,"If you see Tristana activate Rapid Fire in a fight, stun her and try to back off until the spell dissipates."
18,Use Rocket Jump after you have stacked up your Explosive Charge on an enemy to finish them off with a burst of damage.,Stand away from your creeps in a lane to take less collateral damage from Explosive Charge.
18,Use Rapid Fire to help stack up your Explosive Charge on enemy champions.,
19,Follow your Blood Hunt trails to low health enemy champions.,Warwick's attacks heal him at low health. Save your disables to finish him off.
19,"Infinite Duress (R)'s distance scales with any movement speed you gain, even from ally buffs and summoner spells.",Warwick is empowered versus low health enemies. Manage your health to keep him at bay.
19,"Jaws of the Beast (Q) will follow enemies who run, dash or teleport if you keep the button held down.",Warwick's ultimate cast range scales with his movement speed.
20,Consume allows Nunu to stay in a lane against ranged opponents.,Interrupting the charge up on Absolute Zero will lower the amount of damage your team takes.
20,You can choose to interrupt Absolute Zero early for partial damage if an opponent is about to run out of range.,Using Summoner Flash is a surefire way to escape Absolute Zero.
20,It's often beneficial to delay the casting of Absolute Zero until the initial round of disables are used. Try to hang back before rushing into a team fight.,"Biggest Snowball Ever moves very fast but cannot turn as quickly, so don't try to escape it by running away in a straight line.  Instead, make sudden, sharp turns."
21,Miss Fortune ramps up speed if she hasn't recently taken damage. Avoid getting hit to move very fast.,Miss Fortune's speed boost is removed if she is damaged by an enemy.
21,Use Double Up on the furthest enemy minion if enemy champions are hiding in back; it will bounce to them for lots of damage.,Miss Fortune is easy to kill if you can reach her; target her first in team fights.
21,Make sure to utilize Love Tap while Strut is on cooldown to maximize the active's availability.,
22,"Try to fire Enchanted Crystal Arrow in the same direction enemies are moving, so it is more likely to hit.","Ashe has very few defensive options, and she's a good target to gank."
22,"Volley arrows are blocked by the first enemy they hit, so keep your distance to avoid having them all absorbed by enemy frontliners.",Be wary of moving around the map alone if Ashe has not recently cast her Enchanted Crystal Arrow.
22,Hawkshot reveals units in brush. If a team fight is occuring in the jungle it can give you a significant advantage.,
23,Delaying the activation of Undying Rage is a very effective way to make an enemy champion over-commit to trying to kill you.,Try harassing Tryndamere early so he can't kill minions and heal with Bloodlust.
23,Bloodlust is an excellent way to heal Tryndamere. Try not to let it fade off before you activate it.,"Remember, Tryndamere can only slow you if you are facing away from him."
23,"If the enemy is stacking Armor, try building items like Last Whisper or Youmuu's Ghostblade.","Most of Tryndamere's damage is physical. If he's getting too strong, consider buying a Thornmail."
24,"Jax can Leap Strike to friendly units, including wards. You can use them to plan your escape.",Try to engage him in short bursts instead of going toe-to-toe with him. Preventing him from attacking consecutively drastically lowers his damage output.
24,Jax benefits greatly from items that have both Ability Power and Attack Damage such as Guinsoo's Rageblade and Hextech Gunblade.,Jax can dodge all incoming attacks for a very short amount of time and stuns enemies in melee range when it ends. Wait to strike him until after his dodge is finished.
25,Shrewd use of Black Shield can determine the outcome of team fights.,"Tormented Shadow deals tons of damage to units missing large amounts of Health. When low on Health, be wary of Morgana's attempts to trap you within its reach."
25,Items that provide survivability allow Morgana to become extremely difficult to kill in conjunction with Black Shield and Soul Shackles.,Morgana often needs to land Dark Binding to setup her other attacks. Use your minions as shields against Dark Binding.
25,Tormented Shadow is an excellent farming tool if you're by yourself in a lane.,"Black Shield makes Morgana immune to disabling effects, but can be broken with magic damage."
26,You can combine the use of Time Bomb and Rewind to place two Time Bombs on a target quickly. Placing the second bomb will detonate the first and stun all nearby enemies.,"If you're able to match Zilean's speed, it can sometimes be beneficial to wait until his ultimate has faded before landing the killing blow."
26,"Time Warp is an effective way to enable allies to finish off enemies, or escape from a losing battle.","Zilean is fragile if a team focuses on him, but otherwise he's very difficult to kill. Commit to killing him as a team."
26,"Chronoshift is a powerful deterrent to attacking your carries, but casting Chronoshift too early in a fight can cause the enemy to switch targets too soon, making it less effective.",
27,"Poison Trail is very effective at farming and harassing, allowing Singed to dominate the flow of whatever lane he's in.",Keep your distance to avoid being Flung back into Singed's allies.
27,Use Insanity Potion to trick your opponents into chasing you through your Poison Trail.,Singed needs to run close to your team to be effective. Try to take advantage of this by using crowd control effects on him while attacking his allies.
27,Flinging enemies into your tower can deal heavy amounts of damage to them.,"Be careful when chasing Singed. He's very difficult to bring down, and can leave his Poison Trail to damage you in your pursuit."
28,"Allure's arm time might seem long, but the Charm and magic resist shred put Evelynn at an exteme advantage so are worth the wait.",Purchasing Vision Wards can help you detect Evelynn's location in order to prepare for her ambushes.
28,"While stealthed, pay attention to when you are (near) being detected by enemy champions. This is identified by the glowing yellow and red eyes over nearby enemy champions.","A large share of Evelynn's threat is in her charm, 'Allure.' Protect allies marked with 'Allure' or, if you are marked, make sure allies are between you and where Evelynn may attack from."
28,"If at low health, you can take advantage of Demon Shade's healing and Camouflage to return to the fight and surprise opponents.","If you suspect Evelynn is about to ambush one of your teammates, let them know by pinging the minimap and typing in chat."
29,Twitch's Attack Speed is among the highest in the game; try purchasing items with on-hit effects such as Black Cleaver or Wit's End.,Twitch is fragile. Work with teammates to focus on him when you're able to catch him out of Camouflage.
29,Contaminate has a large range; apply as many stacks of Deadly Venom as possible before using it.,"Spell Shields won't block the damage from Deadly Venom, but they will block the effects Twitch can trigger with it."
29,You can catch up to an enemy out of attack range with Venom Cask.,"If you suspect Twitch has left the lane, let your teammates know that Twitch is ''MIA.''"
30,Ask your allies to help point out when you should use Requiem to get kills in different lanes.,Karthus can cast spells for a short duration after he is killed. Move away from his corpse to be safe.
30,Lay Waste is very strong at farming minions and harassing enemy champions.,"Make sure you always have enough health to survive Requiem, even if you have to go back to the base more frequently to heal."
31,Try to line up your attacks with Vorpal Spikes so that they kill minions and harass enemy champions at the same time.,Purchasing a few HP items decreases the chances of Cho'Gath killing you quickly.
31,"If you're having difficulty feasting upon champions, try eating minions until you're larger.",Focus on preventing Cho'Gath from reaching his max size.
31,Using Rupture on creeps in combination with Carnivore is a good way to gain Health and Mana.,Rupture has a smoke cloud indicating the area it will strike. Try to watch out for it to prevent Cho'Gath from being able to combo his abilities.
32,"Amumu is highly dependent on teammates, so try laning with your friends for maximum effectiveness.",Avoid bunching up with other allies when Amumu has his ultimate available.
32,"Cooldown Reduction on Amumu is very strong, but it's often difficult to itemize for it. Grab the Golem buff whenever possible to gain Cooldown Reduction without sacrificing stats.","Erratic movement, or hiding behind creep waves can make it difficult for Amumu to instigate a fight with Bandage Toss."
32,"Despair is very effective against other tanks, so make sure you're in range of opponents with the highest Health.",Amumu's Despair makes purchasing primarily Health items a risky proposition.
33,Powerball can be used as an effective escape mechanism.,Pay particular attention to when his Defensive Ball Curl is off. Rammus has much lower stats than a normal tank when he's out of the stance.
33,Using taunt on a champion by your tower can cause the tower to attack your enemy.,"Rammus often stacks high Armor, leaving him especially vulnerable to caster damage while not in Defensive Ball Curl."
33,"Tremors and Defensive Ball Curl can be used late in the game to obliterate towers. If you're bogged down in a team fight, it is often valuable to break off and attack the buildings.",
34,Timing Flash Frost with Frostbite can lead to devastating combinations.,"Try to gank Anivia when she's laning. With multiple people, it is easier to ensure that her egg dies."
34,Anivia is extremely reliant on Mana for Glacial Storm. Try getting items with Mana or going for a Crest of the Ancient Golem buff on Summoner's Rift.,"If you're playing a ranged champion, stay far enough away from Anivia so you can dodge Flash Frost more easily."
34,It can be very difficult for enemy champions to kill her egg early in game. Seize the advantage by playing aggressively.,Try to fight Anivia in the lanes. In the jungle she can block pathways with lower ranks of Crystallize.
35,Using Deceive over terrain can help you make a clean escape.,"If Shaco is doing well early-game, it is worth the investment to place Stealth Wards near his Jungle camps."
35,Try getting items with on-hit effects. These will also benefit your Hallucination clone.,If Shaco uses Deceive to enter a fight he won't be able to quickly use it again to get away. Work with your team to quickly focus him down.
35,Backstab's damage can be increased with increased Critical Damage effects like Infinity Edge.,
36,A well-timed Sadism can bait enemy champions into attacking you even when they lack the damage to finish you.,"Try to coordinate high-damage abilities with your allies right after Dr. Mundo uses his ultimate, but if you're unable to kill him quickly with burst he will heal through the damage."
36,Spirit Visage will increase the healing done by your ultimate and lower cooldowns on all of your abilities.,Try casting Ignite when Dr. Mundo uses Sadism to negate a large portion of its healing.
36,"Cleavers are a powerful tool for killing neutral monsters. Instead of returning to base, farm neutral monsters until your ultimate can heal you.",
37,"Make sure to tag your allies while Sona's auras are active, but avoid getting caught out by enemies.",Spread out when you see Sona so she can't make your entire team dance.
37,Save Crescendo for the game-altering moment.,"Kill Sona first, as she will heal up her team if left alone for too long."
37,Well-timed uses of Aria of Perseverance will grant you maximum survivability.,
38,Kassadin has multiple item paths; he can go caster via Mana and Ability Power or anti-caster with Cooldown Reduction and Magic Resist.,Kassadin deals mostly magic damage. If he's doing well consider buying magic resist items like Mercury's Treads and Banshee's Veil.
38,"Kassadin's ultimate has many uses and is on a shorter cooldown than most, use it often.","Each time Kassadin consecutively uses Riftwalk, he pays more and more mana. Keep this in mind as you chase him."
38,Try to get the Ancient Golem buff to counteract Riftwalk's increasing Mana cost.,"It takes 6 spell casts for Kassadin's slow, Force Pulse, to become castable. If he levels up that ability, judiciously use your own skills while laning against him."
39,Use Bladesurge to cover great distances by targeting low life minions on your way to champion targets.,Pay attention to Ionian Fervor stacks and try to engage Irelia when it is down.
39,"Defiant Dance is not interrupted by crowd control, try timing it for incoming disables.","Minion waves greatly enhance Irelia's mobility, beware fighting her inside one."
39,"Flawless Duet does not have a maximum travel distance, try using it in creative ways.",Beware of wasting your high impact spells on Defiant Dance.
40,Eye of the Storm can be used on allied turrets.,Save an interrupt ability for when Janna uses her ultimate.
40,Quickly firing a Howling Gale without the charge up can be used to heavily disable the other team.,Listen for the charge up sound on Howling Gale in case Janna is trying to hit you with it from off screen or from brush.
40,Timing Janna's ultimate can push enemies away from a wounded ally or even separate enemies.,"Janna's at her strongest when buffing another ally. If you can harass her ally, it will weaken her ability to fight you."
41,Parrrley applies On Hit effects like Frozen Mallet or Black Cleaver.,Parrrley deals a high amount of physical damage. Items that grant Armor can help if an enemy Gangplank is doing well.
41,Paying attention to low-health enemies on the map can land you a surprise kill with Cannon Barrage.,"Once Gangplank reaches level 6, watch out for his global-range ultimate, Cannon Barrage!"
41,Try placing Cannon Barrage on the path of escape to cut off fleeing enemies.,
42,Phosphorus Bomb can be used to reveal enemy units that might be hiding in a nearby patch of brush.,"Watch out for Corki's Missile Barrage. They deal splash damage, so you can get hit even when hiding behind minions."
42,"Valkyrie can be used defensively as well, so try using it for a quick escape.","Corki is vulnerable after he uses his Valkyrie or Special Delivery, so try switching focus to him if he uses them to enter a fight."
42,Corki can continue to attack while using Gatling Gun. Maximizing Gatling Gun is key to mastering Corki.,
43,Gathering Fire rewards aggressive play. Look to land abilities and basic attacks on your opponent to lower Mantra's cooldown and stay on the offensive.,Karma's passive lowers her Mantra cooldown when she hits enemy champions with abilities and basic attacks. Deny her from getting free hits on you.
43,"When using Focused Resolve, slow your opponents with Inner Flame or speed yourself up with Inspire if you're having trouble sticking to a target. ",Karma's Soulflare erupts for bonus damage in the area in which it's placed. React quickly and escape the circle to avoid taking heavy damage.
43,"Don't be too conservative with Mantra. Gathering Fire is strongest in teamfights, making it easy to recharge Mantra multiple times.",Focused Resolve is a strong disengage tool. Create distance to avoid being rooted and seek to engage afterwards.
44,"The cooldown reducing component of Bravado makes Cooldown Reduction items like Frozen Heart, Iceborn Gauntlet, and Spirit Visage exceptionally powerful on Taric.","Taric's ultimate, Cosmic Radiance, has a long delay before its effect. Try to quickly assess whether to disengage the fight or attempt to kill his allies before it goes off."
44,"Using Starlight's Touch at lower charges makes its healing less Mana efficient, but can greatly increase Taric's sustained damage via Bravado.",Taric reduces his spell cooldowns by basic attacking enemies with Bravado. Try to kite him in teamfights and punish him for approaching the minion wave in lane.
44,"Rather than saving Cosmic Radiance for the last moment and risking someone dying during the delay, it can be more beneficial to cast it as soon as you know a teamfight is guaranteed to start.",
45,Use Event Horizon to increase your chances of landing Dark Matter.,"Dark Matter deals very high damage, but it can be avoided. Pay attention to the sound and visual indicator to be aware of when and where the spell will land."
45,Veigar is extremely Mana and Cooldown Reduction dependent. Try buying items with these stats in order to increase the effectiveness of your passive and Baleful Strike.,"Event Horizon only stuns units on the edge. If you're inside the spell, you can still move and attack."
45,Veigar is very fragile. It is valuable to select at least one summoner spell that can be used defensively.,Veigar's ultimate deals increased damage based on your missing health.
48,Trundle excels at fighting within his Frozen Domain. Try to draw enemies onto it.,Trundle is very powerful at location-based combat. Try to draw him off of his Frozen Domain.
48,Use Subjugate to soften a powerful enemy tank or to create a target for your team to focus fire.,"Make sure to get out of his Pillar of Ice as quickly as possible, as it significantly slows you down."
48,Chomp is good for lowering the physical damage of enemies; try to focus it on enemy physical damage dealers.,
50,"If you're having trouble rooting an enemy with Nevermove, try throwing it at opponents when they are near their minions so the explosion surprises them.",Swain's passive is very potent if you are immobilized. Make sure to be extra careful around enemies who have immobilizing effects.
50,"While laning, try to use Death's Hand's piercing damage to damage opponents from a safe distance.","High mobility counters all of Swain's basic abilities: Death's Hand does more damage the closer he is, Vision of Empire has a very long delay and Nevermove must start returning back to him to be dangerous."
50,"Vision of Empire is quite difficult to land on its own, look for skirmishes around the map where enemies may be distracted or crowd controlled so you can land it more easily.",Buying an item with Grievous Wounds will make Swain much easier to kill during his Demonic Ascension.
50,Demonic Ascension may make Swain very hard to kill but he's pretty easy to get away from. Try building items that can slow opponents to keep them in range if their mobility is overwhelming.,
51,Make use of her Yordle Snap Traps by placing them pre-emptively to ensure that you'll have one off of cooldown during combat.,Keep behind allied minions if Caitlyn is harassing you with Piltover Peacemaker (it deals less damage with each subsequent target).
51,Avoid using Ace in the Hole in large team melees as it might be blocked by the wrong target.,You can intercept Ace in the Hole's missile from hitting an ally if you stand in its path.
51,Fire 90 Caliber Net away from the opponent to close the gap or hop over walls.,
53,"The 1-2-3 combo of Rocket Grab, Power Fist, and Static Field can devastate an individual opponent.",Blitzcrank's passive Mana Barrier grants him a shield when he is low on health.
53,Using Blitzcrank's grab to pull an enemy into your tower range followed by a Power Fist will allow the tower to get several hits on them.,Staying behind creeps can prevent you from being Rocket Grabbed. Blitzcrank's Rocket Grab only pulls the first enemy target it encounters.
54,"Armor naturally reduces the rate that attacks go through Granite Shield, so Brutal Strikes will strengthen the shield against physical damage.",If you're a physical damage character stay behind your allies when fighting Malphite. Ground Slam can significantly reduce your damage output.
54,"Despite his abilities scaling on Armor, some games require Malphite to get Magic Resist. When those games occur, try getting Aegis of the Legion, Mercury's Treads, and Guardian Angel.",Malphite is one of a couple tanks who are capable of jungling. Watch out if he gets Smite.
55,Picking up Daggers will significantly reduce Shunpo's cooldown.,"Katarina's abilities deal magic damage, so even if she's building Attack Damage items, get magic resistance to counter her."
55,"Try waiting until the other team is distracted with fighting your team, and use Shunpo to teleport into the fray and unleash a devastating Death Lotus.",Try to save a disable for when Katarina uses her Death Lotus.
55,"Using Shunpo on an allied Champion, Dagger, or minion can be a great escape tactic.",
56,Using Paranoia at a critical moment is well worth it even if you cannot use the dash.,Stay close to your allies when Paranoia is cast - there is strength in numbers!
56,Duskbringer isn't only an offensive ability. It can be used to close distance out of combat or escape from certain death.,"Nocturne's Unspeakable Horror is broken with range, so try to save your movement abilities for when he casts it."
56,Use Shroud of Darkness in tandem with Paranoia's dash. Your opponents may panic and waste a critical disable on your spell shield.,
57,Saplings can be tossed into brush for empowered effect - but don't stack well.,"Saplings will chase the first enemy that gets too close, but detonate after a few seconds or if they collide with other enemies. Be especially careful around brush sapling, as they are much more dangerous."
57,Try looking for flanks or other situations where Nature's Grasp is unavoidable or takes enemies by surprise.,The cooldown on Maokai's self healing is heavily gated on how many time you hit him with spells. Careful about wasting abilities on him.
57,Maokai's passive makes him extremely durable against focus fire from spells - so long as he can still basic attack something.,"Maokai will avoid taking damage while he's using Twisted Advance, so don't waste your spells."
58,"Slice and Dice excels at harassing maneuvers. Slice in, follow up with another skill and then Dice back out to safety.",Pay close attention to Renekton's Fury gauge as that will usually signify when he is about to attack.
58,Cull the Meek drains an enormous amount of life when used in the middle of the fray. You can use this to bait opponents into thinking you are weaker than you really are.,Keeping Renekton from being able to fight and gain Fury by continually harassing him will severely reduce the effectiveness of his abilities.
58,"Cooldown reduction is especially good for Renekton, allowing him to both quickly build up and use his Fury.",
59,You can use the Dragon Strike / Demacian Standard combo to get out of your own Cataclysm arenas.,Keep out of the path between Jarvan IV and his Demacian Standard to avoid being knocked up in the air.
59,Split your basic attacks on different champions at the beginning of fights to maximize damage.,"Cataclysm's terrain is a frightening force to fight against, but movement abilities can go through it."
59,Use Demacian Standard as a scouting tool when worried about incoming enemies.,
60,Spider Form is most effective at finishing off enemies with low health; Human Form's Neurotoxin does more damage to healthy foes. ,"Elise's Spider Form is more dangerous when you are at low health, and her Human Form more potent when you are at high health."
60,"When in Spider Form, Spiderlings will attack the target that Elise uses Venomous Bite on. ",Rappel will only move Elise straight up and down unless she can descend upon an enemy unit.
60,Elise's Spider Form and Spider Form abilities do not cost mana and can be prioritized when you are trying to conserve mana.,Rappel has a long cooldown. Elise is vulnerable after she has used it.
61,Command: Protect can be used on yourself to return the Ball back to you quickly. Combine this with Command: Attack for a quick harassment.,Orianna can only affect the area the Ball is around. Use this to your advantage.
61,Command: Dissonance is a very powerful escape tool if Orianna has the Ball. The combination of speed and leaving a slowing obstacle can be quite powerful.,Watch out for Orianna's Ball returning to her due to leashing. This may cause some unexpected situations.

Unless you're going all-in, always have a soldier in your back pocket if you need to escape over a wall or if you misposition your other soldier and need damage now.",Azir relies on his soldiers to deal damage and can only move them so often.
